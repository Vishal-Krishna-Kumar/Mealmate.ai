"""LLM-backed recipe generator + Wikipedia image lookup.

When the user asks the assistant to schedule a dish that doesn't exist in
the MongoDB recipe library, the Node server calls
``POST /recipes/generate`` to have Gemini draft a full structured recipe.
The result is then saved to the DB and added to the user's plan in a
single round-trip.

Best-effort image lookup pulls the lead thumbnail from Wikipedia
(no API key required) so the generated recipe card has a real photo.

_RECIPE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a professional chef creating a recipe for the MealMate app.

Generate a complete, REALISTIC recipe for the dish requested below. The
recipe should be authentic to its cuisine, achievable in a home kitchen,
and lean toward the healthier preparation of that dish (less oil/fat,
more vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains) without sacrificing the
characteristic flavour.

Requested dish: {query}

User dietary preferences: {dietary_preferences}
User allergies (NEVER include these or anything that contains them): {allergies}

OUTPUT FORMAT — return a single JSON object (no code fences, no prose
outside the JSON) with these exact keys:

{{
  "title": "<canonical dish name, e.g. 'Chicken Biryani'>",
  "description": "<one to three sentences>",
  "cuisine": "<single word like 'indian', 'italian', 'mexican'>",
  "tags": ["<3-6 short tags like 'indian','dinner','high-protein'>"],
  "ingredients": [
    {{"name": "<lowercase ingredient>", "quantity": <number>, "unit": "<g|ml|cup|tbsp|tsp|piece>"}}
  ],
  "instructions": ["<step 1>", "<step 2>", "..."],
  "prep_time": <integer minutes>,
  "cook_time": <integer minutes>,
  "servings": <integer 2-6>,
  "nutrition": {{
    "calories": <kcal per serving>,
    "protein": <g per serving>,
    "carbs": <g per serving>,
    "fat": <g per serving>,
    "fiber": <g per serving>,
    "sugar": <g per serving>,
    "sodium": <mg per serving>
  }},
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard"
}}

Rules:
- Provide between 6 and 20 ingredients.
- Provide between 4 and 12 instruction steps.
- Use integer minutes for prep_time / cook_time.
- Nutrition values must be best-effort estimates per serving.
- The recipe title should preserve the user's requested dish phrase when it
  is a specific name, instead of renaming the dish to a different variant.
  For example, if the user asks for "cheese pizza", return a title like
  "Cheese Pizza" rather than "Margherita Pizza".
- If the user has allergies, swap conflicting ingredients with safe equivalents
  and reflect that in the title (e.g. 'Dairy-Free Chicken Biryani').
- If the dietary preferences include 'vegetarian' or 'vegan', the recipe MUST
  comply (no meat / no animal products respectively).
